# twoLevelCache
This is an easy implementation of a two level cache.  
I just implemente put and get method for cache to add and retrive data from cache.  
level one cache is in memory with fixed, configureable capacity.  
level two cache is a file system.  
There's many function I haven't declared nor implemented yet, such as the expiration time for cache, which means that our cache will not be GC until we stop the application.
